a. Project Name: Full Points Grade Association (FPGA)
b. Team Members: Jon Ngo, Sophia Delia, Ian Chadwick, Jack Locke
c. Link to your Project Demo Video: TBD
d. Overview of the Project:The FPGA Pseudo Terminal is intended to replicate every day computer actions. A PuTTY terminal is used to display input, while keyboard commands are interpreted by the FPGA to manipulate the VGA display, do calculations via an ALU, trigger a stopwatch, and start a reaction test mini-game. 
e. How to run your project: Generate a bitstream from the top module, and push to the VGA!
f. Overview of the code structure (what code does what): TBD
g. Anything else you feel is relevant: TBD
